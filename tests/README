Unit tests
==========

A (small number) of unit test cases are located in tests/. They are using
the Check unit test framework (https://libcheck.github.io/check/), v0.15.2.
If you would like to run the tests, you need to install this library
(and its dependencies: pthread, subunit, rt, and m) first. The tests work
on my Linux machine, there is no guarantee that they work on other systems.

If you find a problem with the tests, or are able to get them running on
other platforms, I'm happy to accept emails, patches, and merge requests.

The Check unit test framework is LGPL licensed. See the library docs or
their homepage for further information.

Check uses forking in order to limit crashes/segfaults etc. to single
test cases. To ease debugging you can disable forking in test-runner.c
by adding "srunner_set_fork_status(sr, CK_NOFORK)".
